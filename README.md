Hi, my name is Liam Nugent, I am an aspiring developer. At this moment I don't know which direction of development I will take; 

- Full Stack Developer
- Front-End Developer
- Back-end Developer

There are many subcategories of the above-mentioned developer routes and I will update as my preferences change.

I have started at uni and after initially passing my first year at uni on my computer science course I would like to take things a little bit more seriously learning the workflows and proper practices that everyday developers use. Hopefully, over the next three years, you will see my GitHub account populated with little projects and cases that I build to teach myself and learn as much as I can.
